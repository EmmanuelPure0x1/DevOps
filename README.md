# DevOps

### What is DevOps?

DevOps is the combination of the Development pipeline and Operations personel. 

Developers create, fix bugs, code refactor perform security tasks and deploy code to production servers.

Operations personel deal with maintenance of servers and adhere to the needs of the business in a infrastructure capacity.

Both Dev's and Operations encounter issues when working with each others code or infrastructure and that is where DevOps engineers come in.
DevOps Engineers work together with Developers and Operations to bridge the gap between them by beginning to deploy the infrastructure teams infrastructures team as code and automate the pipeline accordingly.

### Benefits to the business

DevOps are a benefit to any tech stack due to their assistance in streamlining the deplyoment of code and tools to the public and assist with ensuring resources are continually accessible alongside the infrastructure team.

### Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is the process of 'offshoring' a companies data to a dedicated remote storage facility. Cloud computing assists in reducing inevitable costs of keeping data locally (On Prem).

**CSP's have the ability to manage:**

- Applications
- Data
- Runtime
- Middleware
- OS
- Virtualisation
- Servers
- Storage
- Networking

### SaaS

Software As A Service (SaaS) is the cloud solution where the cloud service provider (CSP) keeps and stores all the data. 
The benefit of using this solution is that the owner does not have the burden of purchasing and setting up physical hardware, installing Operating Systems, Virtualization, setting up a network, installing and maintaining middleware, runtime and applications.

We benefit from Saas because however big our entreprise is, it is very easay to scale up if required and scale down also. You will only be paying for the resources you use, and you benefit from support should it be required.

You also benefit from automatic software updates with zero downtime at no extra cost. 
 
#### Examples of Saas:

- Tools and applications such Netflix and Gmail operate in a SaaS capacity.

### PaaS

Platform as a Service (PaaS) is the cloud solution that sees the CSP manages all aspcet of the pipeline except the DATA and Applications.

### IaaS

Infrastructure as a Service sees the solutions split somewhat evenly.

This solution keeps control of the following components of a pipeline:

- Application
- Data
- Runtime
- Middleware
- OS

Apart from those, the CSP is put in charge of what remains.
